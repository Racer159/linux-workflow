# Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs)

## So what is a User Interface?

A User Interface is what it sounds like.  It is the interface through which the user interacts with the system.  It determines not only how the elements are displayed on screen, but also the interaction mechanisms by which the user is able to interact with those elements.  There are three main types of User Interfaces which are outlined below:

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** - This is the most common user interface and is what most users are used to using today on their computers.  These allow a user to see graphics and images inline with other content, and usually include a mouse or other pointing device in addition to a keyboard to capture user inputs.

- **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** - This user interface is what we will be touching on in this page and is what PCs largely consisted of once terminal computing became a thing and before Windows, Mac OS, or other Desktop Environments took off.  There are many things you can still do in a terminal today though and many UI paradigms to learn.

- **Command Line interface (CLI)** - This user interface is one of the older user interfaces used for computing and consists of entering lines of text into the computer one at a time and waiting for an expected output.  This differs from a TUI because there is no terminal that can redraw different lines on the screen, and you are only dealing with a single line at a time.

## What kinds of programs can be TUIs?

*Anything* can be a TUI and may likely already have a TUI version.  Below are some examples of common programs and their TUI counterparts:
