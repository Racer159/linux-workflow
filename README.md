# Linux Workflow Introduction

## So what is this repository?

This repository serves as a very basic introduction to the `Linux` operating system, and what differentiates `Linux` from other common operating systems.  While this should be a good introduction to the concept of Linux it really is only the beginning, with the topic stretching very deep and wide due to all of the applications `Linux` can find itself used for.

## First, what is an "operating system"?

Well, an operating system is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, it's a system that helps you operate your computer.  Below is the textbook definition courtesy of [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/operating%20system):

```yaml
operating system (noun): software that controls the operation of a computer and directs
the processing of programs (as by assigning storage space in memory and controlling input
and output functions)
```

What that basically means is that the operating system on your computer is the traffic cop that controls how the applications that you run on top of the operating system are allowed to interact with your hardware.  The core part that makes an "operating system" an "operating system" is the `kernel` which along with `drivers` and `kernel modules` is responsible for interacting with system hardware and doling out resources to each application you'd like to run.  Each OS has their own bespoke `kernel` with `Windows` currently utilizing the [NT Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Windows_NT), and `Linux` using the obviously named [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/).  Below is a diagram from [Wikimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)#/media/File:Kernel_Layout.svg) showing the relationship the `kernel` plays:

## Thats cool... But why `Linux` or the `Linux Kernel`?
