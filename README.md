# Linux Workflow Introduction

## So what is this repository?

This repository serves as a very basic introduction to the `Linux` operating system, and what differentiates `Linux` from other common operating systems.  While this should be a good introduction to the concept of Linux it really is only the beginning, with the topic stretching very deep and wide due to all of the applications `Linux` can find itself used for.

## First, what is an "operating system"?

Well, an operating system is pretty much exactly what it sounds like, it's a system that helps you operate your computer.  Below is the textbook definition courtesy of [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/operating%20system):

```
operating system (noun): software that controls the operation of a computer and directs the processing of programs (as by assigning storage space in memory and controlling input and output functions)
```
